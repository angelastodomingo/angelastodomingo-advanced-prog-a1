## Exercise 5: Password Check ☑️ 

#Develop a GUI App to check the validity of a password given by the user in the entry widget. The password should satisfy the following criteria: 
#- Contain at least 1 letter between a and z 
#- Contain at least 1 number between 0 and 9 
#- Contain at least 1 letter between A and Z
#- Contain at least 1 character from $, #, @ 
#- Minimum length of password: 6 
#- Maximum length of password: 12

#Ask user to include a maximum of 5 passcode attempts. Each time the user enters an incorrect passcode, they should be prompted of how many passcode attempts remain. If there are 5 failed passcode attempts the while loop should break and inform the user that the authorities have been alerted!
