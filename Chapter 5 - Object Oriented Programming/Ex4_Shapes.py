### Exercise 4: Shapes ☑️
#Develop a GUI using Tkinter to calculate the area of Shapes.
#Create a parent class called Shape. This should have the following methods
#```inputSides()``` – Ask the user to enter the sides of the shape. Now create subclasses for a circle, rectangle, and triangle. These should include an appropriate ``` area()``` method that will use the side values from the shape class.
